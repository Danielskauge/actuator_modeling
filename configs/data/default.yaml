# List of configurations for each dataset (mass). Each item is a dict.
# The training script for LOMO CV will iterate through these, using one for validation/test
# and the rest for training in each fold.
dataset_configs:
  - {csv_file_path: "data/synthetic_raw/synthetic_actuator_data_mass_0.csv", inertia: 0.01} # Example from synthetic gen
  - {csv_file_path: "data/synthetic_raw/synthetic_actuator_data_mass_1.csv", inertia: 0.015}
  - {csv_file_path: "data/synthetic_raw/synthetic_actuator_data_mass_2.csv", inertia: 0.02}
  # !!! Populate this list with your actual 15 CSV file paths and their inertias !!!
  # e.g.:
  # - {csv_file_path: "actual_data/trial1_massA.csv", inertia: 0.0123}
  # - {csv_file_path: "actual_data/trial2_massB.csv", inertia: 0.0234}

# `features_to_use` is no longer needed here as ActuatorDataset defines its input features internally.
# The input_dim for the model is dynamically determined by ActuatorDataset.get_input_dim()

target_name: 'tau_measured'
gyro_axis_for_ang_vel: 'Gyro_Z' # 'Gyro_X', 'Gyro_Y', 'Gyro_Z', or null (not recommended)
accel_axis_for_torque: 'Acc_Y'  # Tangential accelerometer axis used by ActuatorDataset

# --- DataModule Parameters ---
batch_size: 32
num_workers: 4 # Set to 0 for debugging
seed: ${seed} # Inherit global seed for reproducible splits in datamodule

# --- Global Split Ratios (used if evaluation_mode: global) ---
global_train_ratio: 0.7
global_val_ratio: 0.15
# global_test_ratio is inferred as 1.0 - global_train_ratio - global_val_ratio (0.15)

# --- Fallback for Data Sampling Frequency ---
fallback_sampling_frequency: 100.0 # Hz. Used if ActuatorDataModule cannot determine from loaded datasets.

# --- System Geometry (passed to ActuatorDataset) ---
radius_accel: 0.2 # meters. Distance from rotation axis to tangential accelerometer.
radius_load: 0.3  # meters. Approx. radius of variable mass load (for record-keeping/future use).
                  # This is an example, update if needed, or remove if not used by ActuatorDataset directly.
