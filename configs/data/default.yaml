# The training script for LOMO CV will iterate through these, using one for validation/test
# and the rest for training in each fold.

  # - {csv_file_path: "actual_data/trial2_massB.csv", inertia: 0.0234}

# `features_to_use` is no longer needed here as ActuatorDataset defines its 5 features internally.
# The input_dim for the model is fixed at 5 by ActuatorDataset.

# --- DataModule Parameters ---
batch_size: 32
num_workers: 4 # Set to 0 for debugging

# --- Physical Parameters for ActuatorDataset are REMOVED from here ---
# k_spring_val, theta0_val, kp_phys_val, kd_phys_val are no longer needed by ActuatorDataModule or ActuatorDataset.
# The ActuatorModel itself will use these from its own config (configs/model/default.yaml) if use_residual=True.

# --- System Geometry (passed to ActuatorDataset) ---
radius_accel: 0.2 # meters. Distance from rotation axis to tangential accelerometer.
radius_load: 0.3  # meters. Approx. radius of variable mass load (for record-keeping/future use).
                  # This is an example, update if needed, or remove if not used by ActuatorDataset directly.
