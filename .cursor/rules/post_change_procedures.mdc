# Post-Change Procedures

## 1. README Updates üìù
After any large changes in the project's usage, methods, overall functionality, or key design choices, it's important to update the main project documentation.

**Action**: Ensure that [actuator_modeling/README.md](mdc:actuator_modeling/actuator_modeling/README.md) is updated to reflect these changes. This file serves as a critical reference for understanding the project's evolution and design decisions, especially for academic purposes like thesis writing.

## 2. Summary of Large Code Changes  summarised üìä
Following any substantial modifications to the codebase (e.g., refactoring, adding significant new features, or altering core logic), provide a concise summary of these changes.

**Action**: Conclude your response with a summary that includes:
*   A clear header (e.g., "Summary of Changes").
*   A list or description of the key modifications made.
*   Emojis can be used for visual clarity if appropriate.
